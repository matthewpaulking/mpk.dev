I love web development. I mostly use Laravel, Vue, and Postgres to build things, with a
			healthy dose of R for data wrangling. I work at the intersection of conservation biology and
			tech, building tools to enable folks to do better conservation.
</p><p>
I'm a second career developer. My career started off in plant ecology, then graduate school
			for paleoclimatology (you can read my thesis <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tePK6T9n6Qk-9wj2A_PCTut47dtF3CPO/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">here</a> if you're so inclined). Now, I mostly focus on building internal tools for wildlife data
			management.
