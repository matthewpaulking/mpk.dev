		<p>Hi, I’m Matt. Thanks for coming to my website!</p>
		<p>
			I love web development. I mostly use Laravel, Vue, and Postgres to build things, with a
			healthy dose of R for data wrangling. I work at the intersection of conservation biology and
			tech, building tools to enable folks to do better conservation.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm a second career developer. My career started off in plant ecology, then graduate school
			for paleoclimatology (you can read my thesis <a

				class="underline">here</a
			> if you're so inclined). Now, I mostly focus on building internal tools for wildlife data management.
